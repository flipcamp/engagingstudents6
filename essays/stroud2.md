*Editor's Note: This resource accompanies Cara Stroud's article ["Transcending the Pedagogical Patriarchy: Practical Suggestions for Including Examples from Women Composers in the Music Theory Curriculum"]({{ site.baseurl }}/essays/stroud1.html)*

Note: I have intentionally limited this list to resources that I found helpful in my own teaching preparation---it is not intended to be comprehensive. This list focuses more on pedagogical musical examples, such as would be helpful for a typical undergraduate classroom. I did not delve into the world of published monographs and edited collections that present scholarly analytical explorations, such as the recently published monograph by [Judith Lochhead (2015)](http://www.worldcat.org/title/reconceiving-structure-in-contemporary-music-new-tools-in-music-theory-and-analysis/oclc/965919842&referer=brief_results) and the collection of essays edited by [Laurel Parsons and Brenda Ravenscroft (2016)](http://www.worldcat.org/title/analytical-essays-on-music-by-women-composers-concert-music-1960-2000/oclc/1015336970&referer=brief_results).

### Published Stand-Alone Anthologies

Briscoe, James R., ed. 1997. [*Contemporary Anthology of Music by Women*](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL4788284W/Contemporary_Anthology_of_Music_by_Women). Bloomington: Indiana University Press.

> This anthology can be a starting place for twentieth-century music. Works are organized alphabetically by composer. Many works in the anthology are selections or excerpts from a larger work; if you find something in the anthology that fits your curriculum, you might need to order a full score.

Briscoe, James R., ed. 2004. [*New Historical Anthology of Music by Women*](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL4788286W/New_Historical_Anthology_of_Music_by_Women). Bloomington: Indiana University Press.

> Entries are arranged in chronological order and selections from each composer are prefaced by a brief biographical sketch. Contains examples from Sappho through Augusta Read Thomas. Most examples are short, complete works. Accompanying recordings are available.

Schleifer, Martha Furman and Sylvia Glickman, eds. 1996--2006. [*Women Composers: Music through the Ages*](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/974560731). New York: G.K. Hall.

> An eight-volume resource. Volumes are divided by time period and performing forces (vocal music, piano music, etc.), and most examples are complete works.

Straus, Joseph. 1993. [*Music by Women for Study and Analysis*](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/27145693). Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall.

> This anthology is now out of print, but it is a very helpful resource of excerpted examples organized by topics in diatonic and chromatic harmony. Since the anthology is limited to short excerpts that primarily illustrate the harmony topic at hand, it would not be useful for a form course. Instructors will need to find recordings of the examples or perform them in class.
